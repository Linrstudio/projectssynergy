PIN layout

  VDD -|\/|- VSS
<-ERR -|  |- DOut->
<- TX -|  |- OE  <-
-> RX -|__|- DIn <-
 
OE  = Transmission Enabled
ERR = ERR is hi when there is no sensefull data coming in, aka no transmitter found
TX  = goes to TX433 module and new data can be presented on DIn on rising edges
RX	= goes to RX322 module and data can be read from DOut on rising edges

how to use:
simple, on each rising edge of TX the user should present a new bit on the DIn pin
on each rising edge of RX the user should read a bit from the DOut pin
